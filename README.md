We had weeks worth of issues trying to just get Ubuntu installed onto 1 of our 6 computers within our group. Once Ubuntu was finally able to be installed, issues prevented us from even being able to make directories and files. In addition to this, the Ubuntu would rarely tell us run a command line in terminal without some sort of unknown error that could not be solve by any posted solution on the internet. Driver issues with graphics cards, WIFI driver, etc. prevented us from being able to complete the project in the time given. Part 3 was only able to be started two days before the assignment was due because of the issues involved with installing Ubuntu and getting Ubuntu to run properly. Also could not access the lab because we are not located in Tallahassee full time and are not comfortable with being in the lab for extended periods of time due to COVID.

All worked together equally in person if possible or over zoom call.
